<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I was getting in touch with computer when I am in secondary school. The IT world attracted me in many fields, I was wondering how could a machine so powerful could connect with all the planet. That was the first sight which I am so interested in IT course . And a few yeas ago I went to a power plant that I have seen so many huge machines were controlling just by a computer ,and then make power to thousands and thousands families to use in life. What an unbelievable story, I will not trust if I had seen it by myself. Thus that I have made a plan to how to handle with this my dream course.



<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<p>IT is moving towards platforms, and then the current trends: cloud computing, Android, Java. The future is definitely the mobile phone to replace the PC, BS to replace CS era. Server-side application development should be very promising.
My ideal job is to use just a laptop can control machine that could reduce mankind things. For instance : check a car is going fine or some parts inside if is broken, or big scale machine to maintain or make it simplely as one man can controlling.
In other side of work, Information Technology could develop many high technologies in many fields. Such as AI machine robots is a typical section, AI could do many dangerous work like search mines in war, taking care of heavy patients in the ICU that normal people cannot do things, just like covid-19 patients lying in the ICU beds so AI robots could get inside the patients’ rooms and do the things that must be isolated for now. At that time, AI robots need Information Technology’s fields’ expects to make the program and modify the rules’ and make the programs much more steady. And make it more safer. I am interested in AI technologies.

<h1>Project Ideas</h1>
<p>Regard to this theme, actually I need to finish the work that teachers ask me to do, to do it better as possible as I can do best. For example, to understand the assignments about course study very dedicated to, and learn more current facilities, perhaps give me more inspirations in my major study cases. Just like make a survey about how AI machines could do some modify data jobs by themselves and make it safe in the same time. Maybe it is impossible thing at this moment. But with time goes by, it is a feasibility thing that IT fields’ people could keep trying to.
