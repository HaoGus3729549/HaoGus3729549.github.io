<h1>My profile</h1>
<p>My name is Gu Hao, I am from China. I am so glad to come to RMIT university, my major course is Information Technology which is IT.
I have had studied in REW in 2019 for a period which was a very wonderful experience. I love teachers’ way in education, make me gained much more knowledge about Australia is quite a powerful nation in tourism and education and other parts associated with many other nations.

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I am so interested in IT course ,so that I have made a plan to how to handle with this my dream course. Because a few yeas ago I went to a power plant I have seen so many huge machines were controlling just by a computer ,and then make power to thousands and thousands families to use in life. What an unbelievable story, I will not trust if I had seen it by myself.My ideal job is to use just a laptop can control machine that could reduce mankind things, for instance : check a car is going fine or some parts inside if is broken, or big scale machine to maintain or make it simple as one man can controlling.
In other side of work, Information Technology could develop many high technologies in many fields. Such as AI machine robots is a typical section, AI could do many dangerous work like search mines in war, taking care of heavy patients in the ICU that normal people cannot do things, just like covid-19 patients lying in the ICU beds so AI robots could get inside the patients’ rooms and do the things that must be isolated for now. At that time, AI robots need Information Technology’s fields’ expects to make the program and modify the rules’ and make the programs much more steady. And make it more safer.



<h1>Project Ideas</h1>
<p>Regard to this theme, actually I need to finish the work that teachers ask me to do, to do it better as possible as I can do best. For example, to understand the assignments about course study very dedicated to, and learn more current facilities, perhaps give me more inspirations in my major study cases. Just like make a survey about how AI machines could do some modify data jobs by themselves and make it safe in the same time. Maybe it is impossible thing at this moment. But with time goes by, it is a feasibility thing that IT fields’ people could keep trying to. </p>
