<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I am so interested in IT course ,so that I have made a plan to how to handle with this my dream course. Because a few yeas ago I went to a power plant I have seen so many huge machines were controlling just by a computer ,and then make power to thousands and thousands families to use in life. What an unbelievable story, I will not trust if I had seen it by myself.My ideal job is to use just a laptop can control machine that could reduce mankind things, for instance : check a car is going fine or some parts inside if is broken, or big scale machine to maintain or make it simple as one man can controlling.
In other side of work, Information Technology could develop many high technologies in many fields. Such as AI machine robots is a typical section, AI could do many dangerous work like search mines in war, taking care of heavy patients in the ICU that normal people cannot do things, just like covid-19 patients lying in the ICU beds so AI robots could get inside the patients’ rooms and do the things that must be isolated for now. At that time, AI robots need Information Technology’s fields’ expects to make the program and modify the rules’ and make the programs much more steady. And make it more safer.
